# TiangongSurveryStrongLensingWorkingGroup

### Simulations

- [x] Building a light cone of sources using HUDF data.
- [ ] Lens extracting from [the Illustris Simulation](http://www.illustris-project.org).
	- [x] Surface Density Map
	- [ ] Light distribution of lenses  

- [x] Ray-tracing light rays through the lenses for sources.
- [ ] Stacking lensed sources and images of lenses.
- [ ] Mock observing: PSF, noise, and bright stars. 

### Lens Finding

- [ ] Training set (10000 fits files with or without lensed images).
- [ ] Building a lens-finding pipeline based on [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano).

### Lens Modeling

- [ ] Applying lens-modeling codes on found lensing systems. 
- [ ] Constraining the mass function of subhalos in the lens.
